# Object-Oriented-Programming
1. Write a C++ program to find the sum of individual digits of a positive integer.
2. Create a class Employee with data members: name, id, basic_salary, and bonus. Write
member functions to:
 Calculate the total salary as the sum of basic salary and bonus.
 Display the employee details along with the total salary.
Create a class named WeatherReport that holds a daily weather report with data
member's day_of_month, hightemp, lowtemp, amount_rain and amount_snow. Use
different types of constructors to initialize the objects. Also include a function that
prompts the user and sets values for each field so that you can override the default values.
Write a menu driven program in C++ with options to enter data and generate monthly
report that displays average of each attribute.
4. Create a class called TIME that:
 Has three integer data members for hours, minutes, and seconds.
 A constructor to initialize the object to zero.
 A constructor to initialize the object to some constant value.
 A member function to add two TIME objects.
 A member function to display time in HH:MM:SS format.
Write a main function to create two TIME objects, add them, and display the result in
HH:MM:SS format.
5. Design a class Complex with data members for real and imaginary part. Provide default
and parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic operations of two
complex numbers using operator overloading.
i. Addition and subtraction using friend functions
ii. Multiplication and division using member functions

6. Create a base class Vehicle with data members make, model, and year. Add a function
displayInfo() to print these details.
Create a derived class Car that inherits from Vehicle and adds an additional data member
carType (e.g.,SUV, Sedan, Hatchback).
Override the displayInfo() function to include the type of the car.
In the main function, create a Car object, set its values, and call displayInfo() to display
the details.

7. Create a base class shape with two double type values and member functions to input the
data and compute area ( ) for calculating area of figure. Derive two classes triangle and
rectangle. Make compute area () as a virtual function and redefine this function in the
derived class to suit their requirements.
8. Create a user-defined exception class to check if a user is eligible for a loan. The
following conditions should be checked:
 User's age should be between 21 and 60 years.
 User's monthly income should be above Rs. 30,000.
 User must have a valid credit score of above 600.
Accept the user’s age, income, and credit score, and check whether these criteria are met. If
any condition is violated, throw an exception with an appropriate error message.
